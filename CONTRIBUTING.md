FFmpegVideoComponent for JUCE projects
=========

FFmpegVideoComponent was developed by Clemens Bergthaller. It is heavily based on filmstro_ffmpeg by Daniel Walz.
I appreciate any kind of contribution, feedback, bugfixes, (...). However i can't promise to realize your suggestions or requests, because they might interfere with my own needs or i just haven't a enough time. 
Please also keep in mind, that this is my first project i publish as open source. That means I still need to learn, I might make errors or forget things.
